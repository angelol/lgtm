# LGTM - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
LGTM is a command-line tool that simplifies the GitHub PR review process by allowing developers to approve pull requests directly from their terminal. The name "LGTM" stands for "Looks Good To Me," a common phrase used when approving code changes.

This tool is designed with a next-level user experience (UX) at its core, aiming to set a new standard for CLI tool design. While maintaining the efficiency of command-line workflows, LGTM brings a polished, intuitive, and visually appealing interface that makes PR review a delightful experience rather than a chore.

## Problem Statement
Reviewing and approving GitHub pull requests typically requires switching context from the terminal to a web browser, navigating to the GitHub interface, and clicking through several UI elements. This context-switching interrupts developer workflow and reduces productivity.

Additionally, most command-line tools for GitHub sacrifice user experience for functionality, leading to steep learning curves and frustrating workflows. LGTM aims to solve both problems simultaneously by providing a seamless, intuitive CLI experience with thoughtful design throughout.

## Target Users
- Software developers who review code
- Engineering managers who approve team PRs
- Open source maintainers who process community contributions
- DevOps engineers who manage deployment PRs
- Developers who value both CLI efficiency and excellent user experience

## User Stories
1. As a developer, I want to approve PRs without leaving my terminal, so I can maintain focus on my workflow.
2. As a team lead, I want to quickly see all open PRs in a repository, so I can manage the review queue efficiently.
3. As an open source maintainer, I want a simple command to approve community contributions, so I can reduce administrative overhead.
4. As a quality-focused developer, I want to ensure I only approve PRs that pass CI checks, so I can maintain code quality standards.
5. As a frequent reviewer, I want to interactively select PRs from a list, so I can quickly review without memorizing PR numbers.
6. As a thorough code reviewer, I want to see the actual code changes before approval, so I can make informed decisions about code quality.
7. As a reviewer, I want to read the PR description to understand the context and purpose of the changes before approving.
8. As a GitHub user, I want a familiar authentication experience that's consistent with other GitHub tools I use.
9. As a new user, I want to be automatically guided through setup, so I can start using the tool immediately.
10. As a CLI user, I want a beautiful and intuitive interface that doesn't compromise on functionality, so I can enjoy using the tool daily.
11. As a reviewer, I want the option to seamlessly transition to the browser when needed, so I can access GitHub's full interface for complex reviews.

## Technology Stack

### Implementation Language
LGTM will be implemented using **TypeScript** with Node.js as the runtime environment. This choice was made for the following reasons:

1. **Type Safety**: TypeScript's static typing helps prevent bugs when working with GitHub's complex API responses and data structures.

2. **Developer Experience**: Strong IDE support with autocompletion and IntelliSense makes development faster and reduces errors.

3. **Code Maintainability**: Types serve as documentation and make refactoring safer as the codebase grows.

4. **Rich Ecosystem**: The Node.js/TypeScript ecosystem has excellent libraries for building beautiful terminal UIs, including:
   - Inquirer.js for interactive prompts
   - Chalk/Colorette for terminal colors
   - Ink for React-style terminal interfaces
   - Boxen, cli-table3, and other formatting utilities
   - Octokit.js for GitHub API integration

5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works consistently across macOS, Linux, and Windows.

6. **Modern JavaScript**: Access to the latest JavaScript features while maintaining backward compatibility.

7. **Error Prevention**: Catches common errors at compile-time rather than runtime, essential for a tool users will rely on daily.

### Node.js Version Compatibility

Since LGTM is a developer tool that will be used across various environments, supporting a wide range of Node.js versions is critical:

1. **Version Support Range**: LGTM will support Node.js versions 16.x through 23.x, covering:
   - Long-term support (LTS) versions (16.x, 18.x, 20.x)
   - Latest stable versions (22.x, 23.x)
   - Future compatibility with 24.x will be evaluated upon its release

2. **Runtime Version Verification**: The application will verify the user's Node.js version at runtime and provide clear error messages if compatibility issues arise.

3. **Transpilation Target**: TypeScript code will be transpiled to target ES2018 to ensure compatibility with older Node.js versions while leveraging modern language features.

4. **Feature Detection**: The application will implement feature detection and fallbacks for APIs that differ across Node.js versions.

5. **Cross-Version Testing**: Both CI pipelines and local development workflows will support testing across the full matrix of supported Node.js versions.

6. **Version Compatibility Documentation**: Clear documentation will be provided regarding supported Node.js versions and any version-specific considerations.

### Key Libraries and Dependencies

- **Commander.js**: For command line argument parsing
- **Inquirer.js**: For interactive prompts
- **Chalk/Colorette**: For colorized terminal output
- **Boxen**: For creating boxes in the terminal
- **Open**: For browser integration
