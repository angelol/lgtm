# LGTM Implementation Plan (Test-Integrated Approach)

## MANDATORY Instructions for AI Agent
These instructions are REQUIREMENTS that MUST be followed without exception:

- You MUST check off completed tasks by replacing `[ ]` with `[x]`
- You MUST keep this plan updated as you implement features
- If interrupted, you MUST resume from the most recently unchecked task
- You MUST update this file with implementation details as you progress
- You MUST add notes about design decisions or challenges encountered
- You MUST create a "Current Status" section at the top to track overall progress
- You MUST follow a test-driven approach: write tests first or alongside feature implementation
- You MUST NOT mark a feature as complete until tests are written and passing (exception: non-testable tasks may be marked complete with explicit notation)
- You MUST always refer to the PRD (Product Requirements Document) when implementing each task to ensure alignment with requirements
- You MUST consider the entire PRD in totality for context and to maintain a holistic view of the product design and goals
